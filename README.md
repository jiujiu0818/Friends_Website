# Friendsdatabase

It's a website about Friends TV show. The main goal is to deliver information including synopsis of each episode, relationships among characters, locations used in each episode, best characters quotations, music, etc; in one phrase all the details related to this TV show. This application is thought for truly fans of Friends, but will be useful for people who is not expert as well, because it will include all the information: from the basics to the most hidden details. Besides the information per se, it has some quizzes in order to improve the engagement of the users with the platform.
